# smallProjectsLibrary
Since I haven't programmed for fun since my father died, I figure I should start doing that again. Anything small I'll put in here.

These are small projects with small contributions at a time, so I won't usually bother with PRs or separate branches.

Why don't I use gists? When I started this repo I hadn't discovered them yet.

## cmd - batch files
### Matrix
This was my first programming for fun project years ago. Back then it was in Java, now it's a batch file. When run it should look something like the matrix screen. 

Some things I could add are that it should sometimes change more than one number, use letters as well as numbers, and have user input to adjust the length of the line to the width of the screen/window. That last part I can't do automatically, just via user input. What I can't do is turn the display upside down, which would make it look more like in the movie.

### TrackYourHours
Times your daily hours as you're working. I want to make it record them automatically to a file, so at the end of the week I can tally them up and send my bill.
