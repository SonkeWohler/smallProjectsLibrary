# Advent of Code 2021

I thought this might be a good time to practice some Rust.  Since I never just
follow tutorials, for some reason, unless I already try to solve another
problem.  Motivation is key after all, [here](https://adventofcode.com/2021) is
one that is as good as any.

There will be a `test.txt` containing a copy of the examples given to test the
code against before running it on the `input.txt` to obtain the correct answer.
