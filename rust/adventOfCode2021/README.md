# Advent of Code 2021

I thought this might be a good time to practice some Rust.  Since I never just
follow tutorials, for some reason, unless I already try to solve another
problem.  Motivation is key after all, [here](https://adventofcode.com/2021) is
one that is as good as any.

There will usually be an `input.txt` inside the `src` directory which is what
is run with `RustRun` inside vim, and another `input.txt` inside the cargo
project's directory which is run with `cargo run` from there.  The former is a
copy of the example data, easy to debug, while the latter is the actual input
used to get the answer.

My priorities here are 1) to learn using Rust 2) to practice writing good code
and lastly 3) to finish the challenge for the satisfaction of it.  This means
that 1) I will spend a lot more time thinking and reading about the code than I
do coding 2) if I have to choose between reading about Rust and writing clean
code (due to time) I will choose to read more and be more messy and 3) I don't
care when or even really if I finish the challenge.
